Environmental Film Festival.\n\nBoth father and son have been tireless vocal advocates for conservation, particularly in the western United States. Their documentary, produced by Jamie Redford and narrated by his father, draws attention to the enormous and, they say, unsustainable demands on the Colorado River system that provides much of the American west with water.\n\n\"The watershed issue is something that's happening all over the world, where the need for water is greater than the amount of water to provide for it,\" Robert Redford told Reuters.\n\n\"I think we're picking the Colorado River as an example of what's going on with watersheds all over the world and trying to focus on that and draw attention to it.\"\n\nThe river flows from the Rocky Mountains 1,450 miles to the Gulf of California. But, as the Redfords' film points out, the water rarely makes it that far because of the multiple demands of agriculture, industry and communities upstream.\n\nThe film opens with an explanation of the history of the Colorado River system's development, starting with the Colorado River Compact of 1922, which provided for the equitable division and apportionment of the water among seven states in the U.S. and two in Mexico.\n\nBut \"Watershed\" holds that the compact, 90 years later, has transformed one of the world's wildest rivers to the point where it will soon be unable to provide sufficient water for the populations dependent upon it.\n\n\"With population in the region expected to reach 50 million by 2050, temperatures rising and precipitation patterns becoming more erratic, demand will outpace supply unless we embrace a new water ethic\" Redford says in the film.\n\nA star of hits including \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\", \"All the President's Men\", \"The Sting\" and the Oscar-winning director of \"Ordinary People,\" Redford hopes \"Watershed\" serves as a warning.\n\n\"There's a new water reality that people have to be aware of, and I think looking at the Colorado River as an example is what this film's about.\n\n\"I think it's using art as a tool for social awareness, you know, making a film about an issue and then getting it out to as many people as possible increases awareness. Maybe increased awareness will help solve our problem,\" he said.\n\nThe film illustrates the various demands on the Colorado River through the eyes of the people who live on it, from a fly-fishing instructor near the river's source to farmers and families living downstream. Jamie Redford said that by enlisting real people in the project, the issue was more likely to resonate with audiences.\n\n\"It was pretty clear from our point of view that what we wanted to do was specifically focus on people, and we wanted to take a positive look at what is a challenging situation,\" he said.\n\n\"So, in that regard, we found characters up and down the river from the headwaters all the way out to the Colorado delta in Mexico that are fighting to make a difference and are making a difference and setting an example of what you can do.\"\n\nAs a California native and long-time resident of Utah, Jamie's father said he has watched the gradual depletion of the Colorado for 50 years and that the issue is too important to ignore any longer.\n\n\"You've got 30 million people dependent on that water source, and a lot of that dependency is urban renewal, booming metropolitan cities. You've got drinking, you've got sanitation and you've got electrical generation. You pull that off the river,\" said Redford. \"Plus, the agricultural water rights that the farmers and ranchers have. You've got a depletion that has to be looked at.\"\n\nAn early supporter of President Obama, Redford said he is disappointed by the administration and Congress's progress on future fuel sources, noting that non-sustainable, carbon-based fuels are a major contributing factor to global warming and the problems facing those who depend on the Colorado River. But no one in government, Redford said, is courageous enough to make decisions that could prevent worsening of the situation.\n\n\"The future is about young people,\" he said. \"Young people coming on today, like Jamie my son, his son, other generations coming, what are we thinking about them?\n\n\"I think we have such a tendency to think short, short term, and therefore apply short term solutions to longer term problems. We're just not going to get there unless that changes.\""},{"articleId":"206","title":"'Hunger Games' gorges on $214 million global debut","source":"Reuters.com","articleLink":"http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/entertainment/~3/Jy3XDgIbY8U/entertainment-us-boxoffice-idUSBRE82O0AS20120326","displayContent":"A marquee advertising ''The Hunger Games'' is seen at the AMC Loews Lincoln Square Theatre in New York March 22, 2012. The film is based on the popular young adult book series by Suzanne Collins.\n\nInternationally, the Lions Gate Entertainment drama about an oppressive society's teen death match added $59.3 million from 67 markets for a global haul of $214.3 million.\n\nThe massive U.S. and Canadian debut for the film ranked behind only last summer's \"Harry Potter\" finale and 2008 Batman movie \"The Dark Knight,\" Lions Gate said.\n\nThe movie's success brings the first blockbuster franchise to Lions Gate, a smaller Hollywood studio best known previously for the \"Saw\" horror series and comedian Tyler Perry's films.\n\n\"Hunger Games\" set records for highest opening of a non-sequel film and biggest debut outside the summer blockbuster season.\n\n\"The first movie in a franchise, to post a number like this, is really insane. There is no other word for it,\" said Phil Contrino, editor of Boxoffice.com.\n\n\"'Harry Potter' had seven movies before it got to that point, and 'Dark Knight' had years and years of building the Batman brand. This movie comes and hangs with them in the same league,\" Contrino said.\n\n\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2\" opened with $169.2 million domestically over its opening weekend, while \"Dark Knight\" took in $158.4 million, according to Hollywood.com.\n\n\"Hunger Games\" is an action-filled survival drama based on the first of three best-selling young adult novels by Suzanne Collins. Jennifer Lawrence stars as Katniss Everdeen, a teen girl who fights in a televised battle-to-the-death ordered by her society's rulers. Everdeen becomes a beacon of hope for freedom against the totalitarian government.\n\nLions Gate executives got a sense of the huge appetite for \"Hunger Games\" when they ventured with director Gary Ross and producer Nina Jacobson to the ArcLight Cinema in Hollywood late Thursday ahead of the first screenings just after midnight.\n\nFans packed the lobby for showings on multiple screens, with many of the book's devotees dressed as characters. Similar scenes occurred across the country. By Saturday evening, executives went to bed thinking the film would finish the weekend with about $140 million domestically. But sales held up stronger than expected from Friday night to Saturday night, dropping just 25 percent instead of the typical 40 percent or more.\n\n\"To launch a franchise like this is incredible. It's above and beyond our expectations,\" David Spitz, executive vice president of domestic distribution for Lions Gate, said on Sunday. \"We're just going to enjoy the ride.\"\n\nGoing into the weekend, industry forecasters projected about $125 million in domestic receipts from Friday through Sunday. Box-office watchers compared the movie's drawing power to the \"Twilight\" vampire romance films, another franchise based on popular young adult books.\n\nThe \"Hunger Games\" blew past the domestic debuts for each of the first four \"Twilight\" films, which Lions Gate now owns after buying Summit Entertainment in January.\n\n\"Hunger Games\" rung up an average of $37,467 at 4,137 domestic locations from Friday through Sunday.\n\nAudiences applauded the film adaptation of the book, giving the movie an \"A\" grade on average in polling by survey firm CinemaScore.\n\n\"Hunger Games\" appealed to more adults and more males than \"Twilight,\" which banked a large chunk of its receipts from teenage girls, Contrino said. Fifty-six percent of the \"Hunger Games\" audience was over age 25, and 39 percent was male.\n\nThe movie cost about $80 million to produce after tax credits. The studio pre-sold distribution rights in foreign markets other than Britain to cut its cost to about $30 million. That reduced the risk but also limited the money Lions Gate will get from overseas sales.\n\nTo reach the film's core audience of younger viewers, the movie's $45 million marketing budget made aggressive use of the Internet, including a game on Facebook, YouTube videos and a blog on the site Tumblr dedicated to the film's fashion.\n\nAnticipation built among fans and on Wall Street, where Lions Gate shares jumped nearly 33 percent in the six weeks leading up to the film's Friday opening. Shares rose from $10.95 on February 8 to $14.53 on March 23.\n\nToy companies also are trying to score big off the movie. Teen retailer Hot Topic Inc said last week it had sold out some \"Hunger Games\" merchandise. Hasbro Inc and Mattel Inc also have licenses to market toys based on \"Hunger Games.\"\n\nTo win the rights to make the film, Lions Gate beat out bigger and better funded rivals with personal appeals to Collins beginning in 2009.\n\nAt the same time, Lions Gate was simultaneously fending off investor Carl Icahn, who took a 33 percent stake in Lions Gate and launched an unsuccessful proxy fight to elect five board members to the studio's board of directors.\n\nIcahn bailed out on Lions Gate in August 2011, selling his 44 million shares for $7 apiece and losing out on a $331 million profit based on Lions Gate's closing stock price on Friday.\n\nElsewhere this weekend, \"Hunger Games\" had little competition at the domestic box office. No other new movies were released nationwide.\n\nComedy \"21 Jump Street\" took second place for the weekend with $21.3 million, and animated \"Dr. Seuss' The Lorax\" finished third with $13.1 million.\n\nRounding out the top five, Disney sci-fi adventure \"John Carter\" pulled in $5.0 million, and military drama \"Act of Valor\" grossed $2.1 million."},{"articleId":"227","title":"\"Smash\" producers get top award by gay media group","source":"Reuters.com","articleLink":"http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/entertainment/~3/5m3KP1Tg37M/entertainment-us-usa-glaad-idUSBRE82O03R20120326","displayContent":"Actress Dakota Fanning arrives at the 23rd annual Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) Media Awards in New York March 24, 2012.\n\nNeil Meron and Craig Zadan, film and television producers known for such movies as the Oscar-winning \"Chicago,\" and \"Hairspray\" were honored at New York's Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, or GLAAD, Media Awards.\n\nThe awards, hosted by Cory Montieth and Naya Rivera from the hit TV musical show \"Glee,\" recognize the best portrayals of gay community members in film, television, radio, music, newspapers and blogs.\n\nGLAAD honored the efforts of Meron and Zadan on \"Smash,\" the program about a Broadway show that features a healthy gay relationship, as well as several of the pair's previous efforts, including the television movie \"Serving in Silence.\"\n\nIn accepting the top award named after gay activist Vito Russo, the producers noted they had received death threats for their controversial 2003 miniseries, \"The Reagans,\" which argued that former U.S. President Ronald Reagan failed to recognize the AIDS crisis.\n\nMeron said being gay was \"part of who I am, so it impacts the work that we do,\" while Zadan said the pair had spent years trying to \"fight, persuade and manipulate\" the entertainment industry to include lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender characters and stories.\n\nHollywood producer Harvey Weinstein presented openly gay high school student Katy Butler a special award in recognition of her anti-bullying efforts, while outstanding TV segment was awarded to \"ABC World News with Diane Sawyer\" for \"Battle Against Bullying.\"\n\nThe 2011 indie film, \"Pariah,\" about a black teenager living in Brooklyn, New York, who embraces her identity as a lesbian, won outstanding film in limited release, and HBO's \"Cinema Verite\" took home the best TV movie or miniseries award.\n\nTV's \"Dancing With The Stars\" won outstanding reality TV program for featuring contestant Chaz Bono, the transgender child of singers Cher and Sonny Bono, who completed a female-to-male sex change in 2010.\n\nPop Star Lady Gaga, who did not attend the awards, won outstanding music artist for her album \"Born This Way.\" Best talk-show episode went to Oprah Winfrey's program for the episode \"Coming Out on the Oprah Show: 25 Years of Unforgettable Guests.\"\n\nPlaywright Tony Kushner won the theater award for his play \"The Intelligent Homosexual's Guide to Capitalism and Socialism with a Key to the Scriptures.\"\n\nAmong other media winners were CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360\", Metro Weekly, The New York Times, The Boston Globe and The Advocate.\n\nGLAAD, which promotes positive images of LGBT people in the media, will present additional media awards in Los Angeles on April 21 and San Francisco on June 2.\n\n(This story corrects to switch quotes between Zadan and Meron, par 6)\n\n(Reporting By Christine Kearney and Chris Michaud; Editing by Peter Cooney)"},{"articleId":"231","title":"\"Lost\" Lempicka set to fetch millions at auction","source":"Reuters.com","articleLink":"http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/entertainment/~3/nDUZSovMY4g/entertainment-us-auction-lempicka-idUSBRE82P0H120120326","displayContent":"'Nu adosse 1' (1925) by Tamara de Lempicka is seen in this undated handout image released to Reuters March 26, 2012.

And also to say, 'I value you'.\"\n\nBut Weiner, who in 2010 left TV audiences with brilliant but mysterious ad executive Don Draper (Jon Hamm) suddenly proposing to his beautiful young secretary Megan Calvet (Jessica Pare), isn't prepared to say much about the upcoming Season 5. Not even what year it is set in.\n\nAll Weiner will reveal is that the new season will be very different, and that after the personal struggles that befell Draper when we last saw him, the enigmatic creative director is \"in the next part of his life, good or bad.\"\n\n\"As it relates to the business and his personal life, Don is in a different place. That is the story I want to tell. You have to be prepared that this season is going to be about something different,\" he said.\n\nTeasers, trailers and previews are not favored by Weiner, partly because he savors surprising fans of the show, but also because much of the fascination of \"Mad Men\" lies in the sub-text and in the slow-burning development of the show's myriad characters.\n\n\"The show has a lot of tension, and some of it is based on not knowing,\" Weiner said. \"This is a commercial property whose success is tied to its mystery and there is very little entertainment out there that provides this surprise.\n\n\"Also I don't have giant nuclear bombs, and plane hijackings and bloodbaths. I have a story on a human level so that things that seem inconsequential like, 'When is it taking place?' and 'What is the state of Don's personal life?' - that is a lot of story.\"\n\nSeason 4 of \"Mad Men\" - which like its three previous seasons won the Emmy Award for best TV drama series - ended with Draper's out of the blue engagement, a promotion and a pregnancy for Joan Harris (Christina Hendricks), the loss of the ad agency's biggest account, and a drastic staff downsizing.\n\nWeiner predicted that after the second episode of Season 5, the audience \"will be 'What happened?! Where is everything from last year?!'. And then by the third episode, they will start to see that this is a new story and they will hopefully get into it.\"\n\nFar from being depressed by the protracted negotiations with AMC in 2010 that briefly threatened the survival of the show, Weiner said that he, the cast and crew went back to work invigorated, and with the assurance of three more seasons.\n\nThe return of \"Mad Men\" has been accompanied by a huge advertising campaign and promotions, ranging from a line of 1960s inspired clothing for retail chain Banana Republic to a retro edition of Newsweek magazine featuring ads with a 1960s look.\n\nDespite drawing a regular U.S. audience of under four million viewers, the series has also sparked new interest in 1960s design and architecture since it first appeared in 2007.\n\nIt has also inspired a slew of 1960s TV shows, including the short-lived and controversial 2011 drama series \"The Playboy Club\", and \"Pan Am\", which is set around the dawn of the commercial jet age.\n\n\"I love this period and it was forgotten by America and I feel happy that I got to be part of something that reminded people of it,\" Weiner concluded about the renewed love affair with all things 60s.\n\nBut apart from its meticulous attention to detail, \"Mad Men\" is more than eye candy for nostalgia seekers.\n\n\"I was a little surprised at what people thought 'Mad Men' was, when I saw these other shows. They thought it was just a collection of clothing and style and that you could put it in any genre. That is not really what is unique about this show.\n\n\"Maybe 1963 has become a big part of our culture and our clothing and our interest right now,\" Weiner said. \"But 'Mad Men' is moving on.\""},{"articleId":"7897","title":"Madonna's 'MDNA' receives lukewarm welcome from critics","source":"Reuters.com","articleLink":"http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/entertainment/~3/4Y1boRj3SC8/entertainment-us-madonna-mdna-idUSBRE82P0XM20120326","displayContent":"Madonna performs during the halftime show in the NFL Super Bowl XLVI football game in Indianapolis, Indiana, February 5, 2012.\n\nThe uptempo record \"MDNA\" sees Madonna continue her love affair with dance music in an album dedicated to club-friendly tracks.\n\nAnd Madonna has lost none of her ability to push boundaries, just as she did 25 years ago with themes of sexuality and youth rebellion.\n\nThe title, \"MDNA\" -- an allusion to the drug MDMA or ecstasy -- has caused a stir, while the music video for the second single, \"Girl Gone Wild\", has been slapped with an age restriction after YouTube deemed it too raunchy for under 18 year-olds.\n\nThe video, shot in black and white, sees the singer writhing and grinding with scantily dressed men, in a style similar to her \"Erotica\" days, when the video for her song \"Justify My Love,\" was banned by MTV in 1990.\n\nMadonna has said that the title meaning of her 12th studio album is threefold -- a reduction of her name, an abbreviation for \"Madonna DNA,\" and a reference to ecstasy and the euphoria often experienced by its users.\n\nBut some music critics haven't exactly been blown away despite Madonna recruiting a bevy of top dance music producers, including house music DJ Benny Benassi, electro-pop duo LMFAO and her Grammy-winning \"Ray of Light\" album producer William Orbit.\n\nRandall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times gave the album two out of four stars, saying it doesn't \"offer much in the way of innovation,\" and that the iconic singer had \"fallen behind...she is no longer setting the conversation in a genre she essentially invented.\"\n\nThe songs are tied together with hard bass beats and electro-synth tunes in uptempo dance songs like \"Gang Bang\" and \"Girl Gone Wild,\" where the matriarch of modern pop music sings lyrics like \"I know good girls don't misbehave, misbehave, but I'm a bad girl anyway.\"\n\n\"Falling Free\" is one of the few tracks that change pace from the album's dance-core theme, described by Billboard's Keith Caulfield as a \"gorgeous ballad.\" The Golden Globe-winning song \"Masterpiece,\" from the soundtrack of Madonna's film \"W.E.\" also stood out with its delicate acoustic guitar melody.\n\nThe singer doesn't shy away from her personal life, with lyrics such as \"I tried to be your wife, diminish myself, and swallowed my life,\" in \"I Don't Give A,\" featuring rapper Nicki Minaj, seen as an allusion to her former marriage with British director Guy Ritchie.\n\nBillboard's Keith Caulfield called the album \"a collection of thoroughly pumping pop tunes, some of which are slices of sheer brilliance,\" praising tracks such as \"Gang Bang.\"\n\nAlexis Petridis of British newspaper The Guardian, gave the album three out of five stars, calling it \"business as usual\" for the pop star.\n\nPetridis added; \"What's striking isn't that Madonna is still with us...so much as where she still is: a commanding presence at the absolute center of pop, as capricious and changeable a genre as music has to offer.\"\n\nBut Nitsuh Abebe of New York Magazine said \"a lot of the music here feels hollow and strained...There is much expensive workmanship and machine-tooling around here, but not much...Madonna.\""},{"articleId":"11920","title":"Jack Osbourne recovering after appendix removal","source":"Reuters.com","articleLink":"http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/entertainment/~3/9Lw3kieD864/entertainment-us-jackosbourne-appendix-idUSBRE82P0Z120120326","displayContent":"Osbourne, 26, posted a picture of himself in a hospital gown with his fiance on Sunday, with the caption \"This is what you look like when you have has your appendix removed.\"\n\nThe reality star remained hospitalized on Monday after his appendectomy and jokingly tweeted \"Man, high powered pain killers + radiohead = dangerous territory for me.

For \"Titanic,\" he took 12 dives to the famed shipwreck in the North Atlantic, leading him to develop deep-sea film and exploration technology.\n\nHe has since led six expeditions, authored a forensic study of the German battleship Bismarck wreck site and conducted extensive 3-D imaging of deep hydrothermal vents along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the East Pacific Rise and the Sea of Cortez.\n\nThe Deepsea Challenge expedition was chronicled for a 3-D feature film set for theatrical release and for subsequent broadcast on the National Geographic Channel.\n\nScripps oceanographer Lisa Levin said the project's potential for generating public interest in deep-ocean science was as important as any new species that Cameron might have discovered.\n\n\"I consider Cameron to be doing for the trenches what (French undersea explorer) Jacques Cousteau did for the ocean many decades ago,\" she told the National Geographic Daily News website."}]
